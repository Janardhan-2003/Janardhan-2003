### About Me

I’m a passionate engineer building the bridge between software engineering and artificial intelligence.  
Currently gearing up for a transformative career—from hands-on MERN development and full-stack applications to deeply technical AI/ML systems like facial sentiment detection, pothole detection using YOLOv8, and adaptive exam generators.

I aim to work at the intersection of **AI/ML** and **real-world applications**, creating systems that don't just predict but **understand**, **solve**, and **scale**.
